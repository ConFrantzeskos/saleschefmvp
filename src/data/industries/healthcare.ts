  problemsTitle: "Why healthcare product content is broken — and why SalesChef fixes it",
  problemsDescription: "Healthcare content is one of the most complex, regulated, fragmented domains in the world:",
  problems: [
    '📋 Highly technical, regulated products — with complex attributes, variant SKUs, and rapidly evolving specs',
    '📁 Content spread across regulatory filings, clinical data, internal documents, supplier feeds, marketing teams',
    '❌ Lack of a true single source of truth for product content',
    '⚖️ Regulatory and legal risk → penalties for inaccurate or non-compliant content',
    '🔄 Constant updates driven by new clinical evidence, approvals, market regulations',
    '👥 Multiple audiences → clinicians, healthcare professionals, patients, procurement officers, regulators — all require tailored messaging',
    '🤖 No structured data to support next-gen channels (AI assistants, voice, chatbots, LLM-driven search)',
    '🌍 High fragmentation across global markets → localisation and translation pain',
    '📦 Burdensome manual effort to prepare content for marketplaces (e.g. Amazon Health, hospital group portals, B2B procurement networks)'
  ],
  
  consequences: [
    'Compliance risk → regulatory penalties, legal exposure',
    'Outdated product data across websites, distributor portals, hospital formularies',
    'Poor discoverability → low SEO & AI surfacing → patients and HCPs can\'t find accurate info',
    'Massive manual cost to update product specs across global sites',
    'Translation/localisation bottlenecks → limits international growth',
    'Lost revenue → slow time-to-market for new products & indications',
    'Inconsistent CX → erodes trust with clinicians & patients',
    'Inability to support new sales channels (marketplaces, AI agents, e-commerce platforms)'

  realityDescription: "SalesChef is purpose-built for industries where compliance meets content complexity meets multi-channel distribution.",

    '📋 Constant regulatory updates → US FDA, EMA, TGA, MHRA, NMPA, PMDA',
    '📊 Content scattered across Regulatory, Medical Affairs, Marketing, eCommerce, Partners',
    '🌍 Local market nuances → translation, compliance differences',
    '🏷️ No consistent taxonomy → hard to drive ecommerce & AI experiences',
    '📤 Every channel wants content packaged differently → distributors, hospital groups, B2B marketplaces, consumer sites'
