Plus, 15-minute quick charge gives you 3 hours backup.'\n\nOBJECTION: 'They look bulky when unfolded'\nRESPONSE: 'That's the genius â€” they fold to half the size. When packed, they're more compact than most competitors, but when wearing them, you get full-size comfort and audio quality.'\n\nOBJECTION: 'What if they break when I fold them?'\nRESPONSE: 'The hinges are tested for over 10,000 fold cycles â€” that's folding them 5 times a day for 5+ years.
