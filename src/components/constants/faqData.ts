  {
    question: "What exactly is SalesChef?",
    answer: "SalesChef is an agentic system that ingests raw, messy product data — from any source — and transforms it into rich, persuasive, sales-ready content. It operates as a dynamic transformation layer, not a system of record. You feed in the mess. It serves up the magic."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of product data can SalesChef handle?",
    answer: "Anything. CSVs, Excel, PDFs, URLs, supplier feeds, ERP dumps, CMS exports, ZIPs of images, even scraped web data. No structured PIM required."
  },
  {
    question: "What does SalesChef actually output?",
    answer: "Persuasive, search-optimised, enriched content blocks: PDPs, SEO copy, FAQs, product comparisons, buying guides, banners, campaign assets, localisation-ready variants, sales training blurbs — ready for any channel."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to integrate SalesChef into my tech stack?",
    answer: "No. It's not another system to manage. SalesChef is a stateless layer — you upload or connect your data, it transforms it, and you take the outputs wherever you want: PIM, CMS, marketplace, ad platform, print."
  },
  {
    question: "How is SalesChef different from a PIM or MDM?",
    answer: "SalesChef isn't a PIM. It doesn't store data or become your 'single source of truth'. It's an intelligent processing engine that radically improves and enriches content — fast — with no migration or stack overhaul required."
  },
  {
    question: "Will it work if I already have a PIM or ERP?",
    answer: "Yes. SalesChef can sit on top of any existing system. It ingests your current data, enhances it, and outputs enriched content. No need to rip and replace."
  },
  {
    question: "How does SalesChef help with SEO?",
    answer: "It auto-generates optimised SEO copy, keywords, FAQs, and meta content tailored to your products and categories — aligned with your brand voice and audience intent."
  },
  {
    question: "Can it handle multilingual content?",
    answer: "Yes. SalesChef agents can generate and localise content into multiple languages — adapting for local tone, SEO, and cultural nuances."
  },
  {
    question: "How does SalesChef ensure content accuracy?",
    answer: "You remain in control. The system includes review and approval workflows. Certain content elements (e.g. legal, warranty) are flagged as fixed and cannot be altered."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see value?",
    answer: "Usually within days. You can upload sample files and immediately generate enriched content for review. Full category transformation typically takes weeks, not months."
  }

export const tourismFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is SalesChef and how does it help tourism organisations?",
    answer: "SalesChef is an agentic content engine that ingests messy, inconsistent, and unstructured tourism data (from thousands of asset owners) and transforms it into beautiful, accurate, multi-language content — ready for any platform."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of tourism data can it handle?",
    answer: "Everything — tour descriptions, accommodation details, menus, event listings, transport timetables, activity guides, opening hours, availability calendars, user-generated content, reviews — from structured or unstructured sources."
  },
  {
    question: "How does SalesChef deal with content that's constantly changing?",
    answer: "SalesChef agents can detect changes, trigger updates, and reprocess content rapidly. It reduces the burden of manually chasing asset owners or keeping content current."
  },
  {
    question: "What about language and localisation?",
    answer: "SalesChef excels at multi-language generation. It creates content adapted for different audiences, regions, and platforms — handling translation and local nuance at scale."
  },
  {
    question: "How will SalesChef save us time and effort?",
    answer: "It automates what is currently an impossible manual task: cleaning, structuring, enriching, translating, and maintaining huge volumes of tourism asset data. Your teams can focus on experience and growth, not wrangling content."

export const mediaFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is SalesChef for media companies?",
    answer: "SalesChef is an intelligent agentic layer that ingests your unstructured media data — articles, videos, metadata, creative assets, audience data — and transforms it into structured, enriched, monetisation-ready content."
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of media data can it work with?",
    answer: "Editorial archives, video metadata, podcast transcripts, image libraries, ad assets, social content, campaign data, sponsorship decks, CRM data — structured or unstructured."
  },
  {
    question: "How can it help drive advertising revenue?",
    answer: "By intelligently structuring and packaging your content, SalesChef makes it easier to segment, target, and monetise — enabling richer sponsorship offerings, dynamic content bundles, better programmatic performance, and improved contextual ad targeting."
  },
  {
    question: "Can it help me understand my content inventory better?",
    answer: "Yes. SalesChef creates deep content intelligence: understanding what you have, how it performs, where the gaps are, and how to surface the right content for the right audience and partner."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it require me to change my CMS or DMP?",
    answer: "No. SalesChef is not a replacement system. It ingests from your existing systems and outputs enriched content and metadata back to wherever you want it — CMS, DMP, ad server, partner platform."
  }
